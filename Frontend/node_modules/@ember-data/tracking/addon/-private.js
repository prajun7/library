/**
 * This package provides primitives that allow powerful low-level
 * adjustments to change tracking notification behaviors.
 *
 * Typically you want to use these primitives when you want to divorce
 * property accesses on EmberData provided objects from the current
 * tracking context. Typically this sort of thing occurs when serializing
 * tracked data to send in a request: the data itself is often ancillary
 * to the thing which triggered the request in the first place and you
 * would not want to re-trigger the request for any update to the data.
